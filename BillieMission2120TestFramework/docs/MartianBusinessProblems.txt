Health Problem:
* Since it is known that the surface gravity of Mars is a lot less than Earth (%38), Martian employees would not be able to stay there for too long 
period of times. Currently there are researches that show low gravity can cause serious muscle and bone problems on humans, so in order to not to observe these 
problems on the employees, Billie would have to send its employees there for much shorter periods such as two to three months. So this means
a lot more trips to Mars. While tere can be many solutions to this(which can be discussed and reviewed continuously during the mission),
first approach can be to send only the most essential employees for the company operations in Mars. 


Logistics Problem:
* The trips must be minimised for economic reasons. Since it's already a very expensive trip to go and come back from Mars, to carry edible goods
continuously would cause failure in a very short period of time. Therefore some solutions must be produced to overcome this problem, 
and one of these can be producing food for staff on Mars. This should be planned before starting business there, so that when trips start occuring these
should be minimised starting from the beginning, for example only goods that are essential for human life and goods that cant be produced there could be carried only,
and goods that can be used to produce other goods can be carried also.
